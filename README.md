User Behavior Analysis with Python
This project analyzes user behavior patterns using Python's powerful libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
The goal of this analysis is to uncover insights into how different device models are used, particularly focusing on app usage time per day. 
The visualizations provide an easy-to-understand summary of these patterns.
